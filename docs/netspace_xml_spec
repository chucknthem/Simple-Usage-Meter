root tag 
<USAGE>
</USAGE>

underneath the root tag are tags of 
<START_DATE></START_DATE>
<END_DATE></END_DATE>
<GRANULARITY></GRANULARITY>
<VERSION></VERSION>
<PLAN DESCRIPTION="plan description"></PLAN>
<DATABLOCKS></DATABLOCKS>
<TRAFFIC DESCRIPTION="description"></TRAFFIC>
<MESSAGE ID="n"></MESSAGE>

a) <START_DATE> & <END_DATE>
Represent the start and end date of the billing period.
both have sub attributes: <DAY></DAY><MONTH></MONTH><YEAR></YEAR>

b) <GRANULARITY>
This is how fine or coarse you want the data. At the moment, the only
value you will get is MONTH and DAY. We might extend this one day. 
A specific granularity can be requested using the form field in your
post/get request of "granularity=GRAN" (where GRAN = "MONTH" or "DAY") -
nothing at all, or a non-supported granularity will return a monthly
granularity.

c) <VERSION></VERSION>
This basically defines the internal version of the XML (Not the version
of this document). The version of the XML which this docuement defines
can be found up the top of the document. If there is no version listed,
then its version 1, which was current until version 1.9 of this document.
You can request different versions of the XML by using a form field in
your get/post request of "version=x" (where x is the version of the xml 
your requesting). If none is supplied, version 1 is assumed.

d) <PLAN DESCRIPTION="plan description"></PLAN>
This defines the plan which the user is on. There is a <LIMIT></LIMIT>
tag for every limit for the plan
i) <LIMIT NAME="limit name" MEGABYTES="megabytes" />
The "limit name" will be something like "Peak" , "Off Peak", etc - and
will match the description found below. The MEGABYTES attribute will give
a figure for the number of free megabytes for that limit.

e) <DATABLOCKS></DATABLOCKS>
This section covers blocks of data which have been purchased to "top up"
an account for the current billing period. It has an entry for every
timing period which is valid for the account. (see <LIMIT NAME="blah">
above. 
i) These tags look like <LIMIT Name="Standard"></LIMIT>. This is the 
period for which the block was purchased. Within each limit, the actual 
blocks of data are listed.
I) The format is <BLOCK DATEPURCHASED="YYYY-MM-DD" MEGABYTES="999"></BLOCK>.
This means that on the date given, the number of megabytes specificed were
purchased for use. There can be multiple BLOCKs listed.

f) <TRAFFIC DESCRIPTION="description"></TRAFFIC>
For each type of traffic, there is a description. So at present the attribute
for DESCRIPTION will be "Free Traffic" and "Normal Billable Traffic".
Within the <TRAFFIC></TRAFFIC> tags, there are a number of <DATA> tags, one
for every time and billing type (ie peak and off peak).
i) <DATA TIMESTAMP="YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" TYPE="Billing Type"></DATA>
The timestamp is the timestamp for the traffic being billed. For monhtly
granularity there is one for each TYPE. In general TYPE won't change,
however there is the possibility of new TYPEs being added. At present,
there are three values - "Peak", "Off Peak", and "Standard" -
"Standard" is desgined for the Lite plans which have no concept of
"Peak" and "Off Peak". At the moment, the word "Standard" isn't
confirmed to stay that way - check for updates to this document 
to find what it will change to. 
Within the <DATA></DATA> tags are <DOWNLOADS></DOWNLOADS> and 
<UPLOADS></UPLOADS> tags. These, funnily enough, have the number of megs
downloaded and uploaded. Note however, that UPLOADS will now be defined
to be 0, as we are no longer providing uploaded data stats.

g) <MESSAGE ID="n" TIMESTAMP="Sun Jul 14 11:03:15 2002"></MESSAGE>
Basically, a messaging interface. This can be used by Netspace to let
customers know information when it is applicable. Each message will have a
unique ID field, so these can be stored so that repeat messages aren't 
displayed each time. The timestamp will tell you when the message was put
into the system. There are 2 elements within the <MESSAGE></MESSAGE>
tags: a <TITLE></TITLE> tag which is the title of the message, and a 
<TEXT></TEXT> tag which is the actual text of the message. The text will
have all "<"'s replaced with "<" so that any tags remain intact and
are interpreted as part of the text, not the html.

Examples of data which might be included in this field: Usage meter issues,
major outages, etc. The messages will probably be a little more verbose
than the messages listed below in the example.

So if you're requesting the following URL:

https://usage.netspace.net.au/usage-meter/adslusage?version=3&granularity=MONTH

you might get:

<USAGE>
<GRANULARITY>MONTH</GRANULARITY>
<START_DATE>01-04-2002</START_DATE>
<END_DATE>30-04-2002</END_DATE>
<VERSION>3</VERSION>

</LIMIT>

means that the billing period is 01-Apr-2002 to 30-Apr-2002 during that 
period, the Normal Billable Traffic during Peak was 3870Mb downloads and 432Mb 
uploads; Off peak was 3419Mb down and 472Mb up, and the free traffic during 
peak was 57Mb down and 9Mb up, with 7Mb down and 2Mb up during off peak. 
There are obviously 2 messages included in there, and the plan details are 
listed up the top as being on the 512k plan, which has 4500Mb of peak downloads,
and 7000Mb of off peak downloads available in total. The version of the
returned XML is 3. The user has also purchased 2 data blocks for their Peak 
usage period - of 500Mb each (which will be taken into account during end
of month billing, or shaping calculations).

A couple of FAQs about this spec:

Q: How does the xml feed know which user its fetching data for?

A: This is done through HTTP basic auth. Basically, your code needs to send
a HTTP header along with its get/post request which includes the relevant
username and password. This is same header a normal web browser would send
when you type a username/password into a pop up box.
